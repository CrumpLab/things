## Excuses

No online store at the moment, a bit busy with other stuff, email me about prints or DM on instagram [@mattcrumplab](https://www.instagram.com/mattcrumplab/) I suppose.

## Scribble Picture Open Edition Prints

Prints from the scribble picture series are available for purchase:

- Regular size = $75 + shipping
- Jumbo size = $100 + shipping

Prints are shipped in a tube. Usually about $10 to ship. Multiple prints ship in the same tube.

These prints are digitally signed open edition prints. Each print shows the print number in order of printing. If you get the first one, then it says #1, otherwise #2 etc. Each print shows the scribble picture number. The one above is Scribble Picture 24. Each print shows the year and I sign each one on the right hand side.

The regular size is an 18x27 print on 20.5 x 29.5 matte cotton natural white art paper.

The jumbo size is a 22x33 print on 24.5 x 35.5 matte cotton natural white art paper.

Both prints have a 1.25" border, which should accommodate some framing preferences. My preferred framing option uses 2" matting. The matting is cut to leave 1" of the border from the print showing (to give a double matted appearance). The extra .25" on the print is for matting tolerance. Note these prints are unframed.

Framed options could be available too. Some rough estimates are:

Framed 18x27 print = $75 (print) + $150 (frame) + shipping ($20-30)

- Frame dimensions about 25" x 34"
- Single Matte
- Clear acrylic protective cover
- Black satin metal frame
